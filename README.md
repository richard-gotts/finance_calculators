# Finance Calculators

This program allows the user to either calculate their return on an investment or calculate the amount that should be repaid on a bond each month.

### Investment Calculator

The user enters the amount of money they are investing, the interest rate, the number of years they plan on investing, and whether they want simple or compound interest. The program will calculate the return on this investment after the specified number of years.

### Bond calculator

The user enters the value of their house, the interest rate, and the number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. The program will calculate the monthly repayment required to repay the bond in this time.
